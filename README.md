## django Project Setup

**python3.11 -m venv .venv** - Creates a new virtual environment 

**mkdir django-things** - Creates a new directory for django package 
- Install Django package in django-things with pip install django

**django-admin star project django_things_project .**  

- Does two things:
    1. Creates a folder named django_things_project in the current folder
        * Newly created folder contains starting files
    2. Creates a  “manage.py” file - Django’s command-line utility for admin tasks
        * **python manage.py runserver** - Does 2 things
            1. Starts the development server
                * To exit the server, control + c
        * **python manage.py migrate** - applies all the un-migrated migrations into django

## django App Setup

**python manage.py startapp <app name>** - creates an directory(package) named <app name>
    * MUST connect the app to the project! This is done by going into “settings.py --> add app name to list named “INSTALLED_APPS

## VUT process

V - views.py - handles all of the logic of that call back functionality

	From django.views.generic import TemplateView
	Class HomePageView(Templateview):
	template_name = ‘home.html’

U - urls.py - the file that contains all of the routes to be handles in view.py
	
	from django.urls import path
	from .views import HomePageView

	url patterns = [
		path(‘’, HomePageView.as_view(), name=“home”),
	]

T - templates - directory created in the base “django-things” directory
	 
1. Create a file named “base.html”
    * ! and pressing enter will generate the base html code
    * django tags ({%__some tag__%]) are used in the template files, these serve as a way to connect code in django
   
2. Create a file named “home.html”

    ```
    COMPRESS_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static'
    COMPRESS_ENABLED = True
    STATICFILES_FINDERS = ('compressor.finders.CompressorFinder’,)
